# Combining happens on each map node, and is called with an arbitrary number

# a record of the same "schema" as the map function does.

# In this case, we combine the records by counting the records.

# After all of the map records for a particular key have been
# collected, reduction can count or combine these records (it could
# e.g. produce a histogram or some other complex structure).
# 
# In this case, reduction is the exact same as combining, it just adds
# the map and/or combine results together.
